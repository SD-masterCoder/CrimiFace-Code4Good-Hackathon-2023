## How was CrimiFace built? Built using Python: - Used OpenCV library for the camera and UI. - Used Face-Recognition library to set up the facial recognition. 
- Used Firebase, to setup the real time database. ## More Details... - The Face-Recognition library is a trained ML model to detect faces. It has a accuracy of 99.38% !! 
- Firebase is a cloud based platform created by Google that offers developers a range of tools and services to build and manage applications. It simplifies development by providing features like real time database, user authentication, and cloud storage.
